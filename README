File-GetLineMaxLength version 1.01
==================================

File::GetLineMaxLength - Get lines from a file, up to a maximum line length

While generally reading lines of data is easy in perl (eg C<E<lt>$FhE<gt>>),
there's apparently no easy way to limit the read line to a maximum length
(as in the C call C<fgets(char *s, int size, FILE *stream)>). This can
lead to potential DOS situations in your code where an attacker can send
an arbitrarily large line and use up all your memory. Of course you can
use things like BSD::Resource to stop your program using all memory,
but that just kills off the process and gives you no more information
about what was causing the problem.
